# Swift Fundamentals
Swift basics and testable logic to demonstrate language foundations: optionals, protocols, generics, and unit tests.

## Whatâ€™s here
- `MathUtils` (pure functions with tests)
- `StringUtils` (optionals, extensions)
- Examples in `main.swift`

## Run (web)
Use an online Swift runner. Paste `main.swift` into the editor together with `MathUtils` and `StringUtils` and run. Copy output below.
## Sample Output
```

Hello, Deepthi!
Hello, there!
```
## Run (local SPM)
If you have Swift locally:
```bash
swift build
swift test
swift run
